SimpleColorThresholder: 
This is a simple version of a program that takes in Vid1.mp4 and outputs an updated video showing only pixels with certain color values. The result is stored in SimpleColorThresholder.mp4. 

GaussianColorThresholder: 
This is a more complex version of SimpleColorThresholder. They do essentially the same thing, but this method uses a gaussian filter to update the video. This results in a more accurate filter for the orange cylinder. The result is stored in GaussianColorThresholder.mp4.
